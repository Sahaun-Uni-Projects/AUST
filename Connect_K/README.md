In memories of the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect 4</a>, this minimal (and unoptimized) Java console game was born.

Instructions are mentioned pretty well per move.
Select the grid size and the number of desired matches before each game, and enjoy!

Prerequisites:
<ol>
<li>You should have JDK installed. Instructions can be found <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you are not using a Java IDE, copy all the contents to a text file and name it 'Connect_K.java'. You can compile and run it manually. Necessary instructions can be found <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-run-a-java-program">here</a>.</li>
<li>Rules of Connect 4 can be found <a href="http://www.ludoteka.com/connect-4.html">here</a>. This game is similar, except you need to match K elements instead of 4.</li>
</ol>
